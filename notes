done up to now, but need to make sure doing as I go
- link hover changes - use transition to make it slightly slower
- make responsive
- vendor prefixes (https://autoprefixer.github.io/)


color scheme? play with lighten/darken for all instances of color

last bit: about text, about styling

bg images disappeared?? 

images over just APIs too boring - rearrange, or find image


maybe check if any cool features (animations, etc) from example sites I'd want to use

at end 
  - check all links and text and images
  - check in browsers in Windows
  - figure out hosting (github pages?)


could remove:
Wikipedia search
Timestamp API
Markdown Previewer

perhaps add pomodoro clock react, as it has testing (maybe instead of md? or one of the others above. but keep old pomodoro too)
